import random numbers

create a list (BOARD) where the rows are other smaller lists
board = [[1,2,3]
[4,5,6]
[6,7,8]]
create a win variable = 0

display a welcome message

start a while loop where condition is win < 1 
   print BOARD (for list in board print list) and ask what row and then what column they want to get the index 
        check if spot is taken by either an X or an O already and if so 
        display invalid, select again
            continue
        else we would
            change what they chose to == "X"
        import 2 random numbers (1,10) to get the row and column for the computers spot
        check if spot is taken by either an X or an O already and if so 
            generate a different number
        else we would 
            change the computers spot to == "O"

    check if row lists == each other (all x or all o)
        display either x or o wins
        win +=1
        display thank you for playing
        break
    or if any of the columns == each other
        display either x or o wins
        win +=1
        display thank you for playing
        break
    or if the diagonals (found with index) == each other
        display either x or o wins
        win +=1
        display thank you for playing
        break
    else 
        continue
